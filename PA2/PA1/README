Build by using the make command in PA1/ directory
The target is called PA1
To run use
./PA1 [config_file_path]
e.g.
./PA1 test.conf

All errors specified in the clarification email are accounted for; however, I
would like to in the future add error handling for unexpected values in the
.conf files, as well as any missing config data, such as not setting keyboard
cycle times.

Project Information:
This project parses a config file and saves all of those setings in a Config
data structure.  It then parses a meta-data program file and outputs time data
for each action with information from the aforementioned Config data
structure.  It will log this data and config settings to the appropriate
locations based on what "Log to" is set to in the .conf file.
Config files must be .conf file extensions.
Metadata files must be .mdf file extensions.
They both must be non-empty.
