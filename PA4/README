Build by using the make command in PA4/ directory
The target is called PA4
To run use
./PA4 [config_file_path]
e.g.
./PA4 test.conf

Project Information:
This project parses a config file and saves all of those setings in a Config
data structure.  It then parses a meta-data program file and loads that code into memory.
It then runs that code in real time outputting timestamps and information regarding the processes
being run. It will log this data and config settings to the appropriate locations based on what "Log to" is set to in the .conf file.
Config files must be .conf file extensions.
Metadata files must be .mdf file extensions.
They both must be non-empty.

In addition to the mutexes and semaphores used for I/O devices implemented in
PA3, PA4 implements scheduling to alter the order in which processes run.

The currently implemented scheduling strategies are SJF,FIFO, and PS. These
are set on hte CPU Scheduling Code: line in the config file.  The ordering of
the process queue is done in scheduler.cpp.  These functions are called before
running the processes in metadata.cpp:233.
