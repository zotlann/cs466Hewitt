Build by using the make command in PA3/ directory
The target is called PA2
To run use
./PA3 [config_file_path]
e.g.
./PA3 test.conf

Project Information:
This project parses a config file and saves all of those setings in a Config
data structure.  It then parses a meta-data program file and loads that code into memory.
It then runs that code in real time outputting timestamps and information regarding the processes
being run. It will log this data and config settings to the appropriate locations based on what "Log to" is set to in the .conf file.
Config files must be .conf file extensions.
Metadata files must be .mdf file extensions.
They both must be non-empty.

In addition to the pcb and pthreads implemented in PA2, PA3 uses semaphores
and mutexes for handling all I/O devices.  sem_t and pthread_mutex_t for each
devices are declared in metadata.h:100 to metadata.h:114

These are utilized using the sem_wait, and mutex_lock functoins on the
appropriate sem_t and pthread_mutex_t variables when starting I/O processes.
sem_wait and pthread_mutex_lock are used in metadata.cpp:332 to
metadata.cpp:357 depending on the device used for input.  As well as in
metadata.ccp:446 through metadata.cpp:472 depending on the device used for
output.
sem_post and pthread_mutex_unlock are used in metadata.cpp:368 through
metadata.cpp:394 depending on the evice used for input, and in  metadata.cpp:482 through
metadata.cpp:508 depending on the device used for output.
